## Week 1 Summary (09/08/2025)

### This week I worked on:

Brainstorming for my project in a the music field.

### This week I learned:

Dr. Shapovalov is making a website for the music deparmtent.

### My successes this week were:

Briefly discussing my ideas with Mahoney, either for some extension of Dr. Shapovalov's work or a simple compositional app.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

Having to prepare for my pre-recital jury for my music thesis.

---

## Week 2 Summary (09/15/2025)
### This week I worked on:

Very little.

### This week I learned:

That rehearsals for a small-group is hard to schedule.

### My successes this week were:

Devoting time to my pre-recital jury preparation.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

Devoting time to my pre-recital jury preparation.

## Week 3 Summary (09/22/2025)
### This week I worked on:

Meeting with Dr. Shapovalov and establishing what pieces of his website might be extendable for my project.

### This week I learned:

The two main extensions that seem possible are a melodic dictation route, which would be similar to a small-scale compositional work but with a lot less rendering necessary, and an assessment route, in which I design something which can adequately detect pitch within the human voice.

### My successes this week were:

Establishing there is a project to be completed with Dr. Shapovalov's website.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

We're not sure how we'll be able to connect my code edits to his private repository, and he has yet to actually share the website with me so I can look into it more.

---

## Week 4 Summary (09/29/2025)
### This week I worked on:

Following up with Dr. Shapovalov and establishing next steps with Dr. Mahoney and Dr. Zak.

### This week I learned:

I need to determine if I'l be able to manipulate the raw output of a microphone from web browsers.

### My successes this week were:

Meeting and corresponding with the various professors.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

Actually motivating myself to do very much research into the necessary questions standing between me and my elevator pitch.

---

## Week 5 Summary (10/06/2025)
### This week I worked on:

Exploring the feasibility of real-time human voice pitch recognition as a senior thesis project.

### This week I learned:

Real-time human voice pitch recognition would not be an optimal thesis. I learned that the main issues facing real-time pitch recognition are consistency and timeliness; while I do have some ideas on how we might effectively reduce the time needed to calculate a pitch for Dr. Shapovalov's website--through being octave indiscriminate and having a known range for pitches selected by the user--it seems these solutions will either be relatively easy to implement or not adequately address the problem, with little in-between. On the other hand, a lot of genuinely interesting research is being done into how to increase the consistency of pitch-recognition models and decrease how much time it takes them to arrive at those conclusions--including by using AI to determine the likelihood of an actual pitch being detected. However, pursuing that research would be unlikely to produce a deliverable project, which is what I'd like to pursue for my thesis.

### My successes this week were:

Determining I should commit to building a melodic dictation page for my project and discussing the groundwork for this with Dr. Mahoney and Dr. Zak.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

Trying to navigate the various studies and models used for real-time pitch recognition and determine which would be helpful in concluding the feasibility of that subject as a thesis project.

---

## Week 6 Summary (10/13/2025)
### This week I worked on:

Not much beyond continuing to refine my elevator pitch.

### This week I learned:

Dr. Shapovalov and I need to find a way to share code back and forth without making his repository public.

### My successes this week were:

Reading and responding to one email.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

Trying to work on the project alongside preparation for my senior thesis.

---

## Week 7 Summary (10/20/2025)
### This week I worked on:

Determining how to share code with Dr. Shapovalov and scheduling a meeting with him.

### This week I learned:

We can use a scaled-back version of his website, effectively a LTS version, for me to build a melodic dictation route on top of a more static page. He has now shared this with me through github as a private collaborator.

### My successes this week were:

Getting access to Dr. Shapovalov's code.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

Not being able to meet with Dr. Shapovalov due to his busy schedule and my upcoming recital.

---

## Week 8 Summary (10/27/2025)
### This week I worked on:

Delivering my elevator pitch and beginning to write the spec based on Dr. Shapovalov's current website.

### This week I learned:

Dr. Shapovalov and I need to meet asap to review my use spec and ideas for use cases. It is in fact feasible for me to start with the page loading, then loading an example and producing a tone, then entering a note, then grading the entered values, then moving to solfege and other options, then moving to generation or storage of the examples.

### My successes this week were:

Beginning work on my spec and scheduling an upcoming meeting with Dr. Shapovalov.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

Again failing to properly meet with Dr. Shapovalov to discuss the project. I also think I may need to address the issue of how to test and store/generate examples sooner rather than later.
