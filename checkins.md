## Week 1 Summary (09/08/2025)

### This week I worked on:

Brainstorming for my project in a the music field.

### This week I learned:

Dr. Shapovalov is making a website for the music deparmtent.

### My successes this week were:

Briefly discussing my ideas with Mahoney, either for some extension of Dr. Shapovalov's work or a simple compositional app.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

Having to prepare for my pre-recital jury for my music thesis.

## Week 2 Summary (09/15/2025)
### This week I worked on:

Very little.

### This week I learned:

That rehearsals for a small-group is hard to schedule.

### My successes this week were:

Devoting time to my pre-recital jury preparation.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

Devoting time to my pre-recital jury preparation.

## Week 3 Summary (09/22/2025)
### This week I worked on:

Meeting with Dr. Shapovalov and establishing what pieces of his website might be extendable for my project.

### This week I learned:

The two main extensions that seem possible are a melodic dictation route, which would be similar to a small-scale compositional work but with a lot less rendering necessary, and an assessment route, in which I design something which can adequately detect pitch within the human voice.

### My successes this week were:

Establishing there is a project to be completed with Dr. Shapovalov's website.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

We're not sure how we'll be able to connect my code edits to his private repository, and he has yet to actually share the website with me so I can look into it more.

---

## Week 4 Summary (09/29/2025)
### This week I worked on:

Following up with Dr. Shapovalov and establishing next steps with Dr. Mahoney and Dr. Zak.

### This week I learned:

I need to determine if I'l be able to manipulate the raw output of a microphone from web browsers.

### My successes this week were:

Meeting and corresponding with the various professors.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

Actually motivating myself to do very much research into the necessary questions standing between me and my elevator pitch.

## Week 5 Summary (10/06/2025)
### This week I worked on:

Exploring the feasibility of real-time human voice pitch recognition as a senior thesis project.

### This week I learned:

Real-time human voice pitch recognition would not be an optimal thesis. I learned that the main issues facing real-time pitch recognition are consistency and timeliness; while I do have some ideas on how we might effectively reduce the time needed to calculate a pitch for Dr. Shapovalov's website--through being octave indiscriminate and having a known range for pitches selected by the user--it seems these solutions will either be relatively easy to implement or not adequately address the problem, with little in-between. On the other hand, a lot of genuinely interesting research is being done into how to increase the consistency of pitch-recognition models and decrease how much time it takes them to arrive at those conclusions--including by using AI to determine the likelihood of an actual pitch being detected. However, pursuing that research would be unlikely to produce a deliverable project, which is what I'd like to pursue for my thesis.

### My successes this week were:

Determining I should commit to building a melodic dictation page for my project and discussing the groundwork for this with Dr. Mahoney and Dr. Zak.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

Trying to navigate the various studies and models used for real-time pitch recognition and determine which would be helpful in concluding the feasibility of that subject as a thesis project.

## Week 6 Summary (10/13/2025)
### This week I worked on:

Not much beyond continuing to refine my elevator pitch.

### This week I learned:

Dr. Shapovalov and I need to find a way to share code back and forth without making his repository public.

### My successes this week were:

Reading and responding to one email.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

Trying to work on the project alongside preparation for my senior thesis.
