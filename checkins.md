## Week 3 Summary (09/22/2025)
### This week I worked on:

Meeting with Dr. Shapovalov and establishing what pieces of his website might be extendable for my project.

### This week I learned:

The two main extensions that seem possible are a melodic dictation route, which would be similar to a small-scale compositional work but with a lot less rendering necessary, and an assessment route, in which I design something which can adequately detect pitch within the human voice.

### My successes this week were:

Establishing there is a project to be completed with Dr. Shapovalov's website.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

We're not sure how we'll be able to connect my code edits to his private repository, and he has yet to actually share the website with me so I can look into it more.
